# anixe
A Go command line utility to authenticate to AWS using various identity providers

## Inspiration

I have written multiple versions of this in the past. While progress has been made
with the AWS CLI and other utilities, they all generally require access to a web
browser for authentication. This utility eliminates that as a requirement.
